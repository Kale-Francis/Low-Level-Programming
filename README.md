# C Programming Masterclass: 11-Day Intensive

## Project Overview

Welcome to my journey of mastering the C programming language in an intensive, 11-day curriculum. This repository documents my progress, projects, and solutions as I work to build a strong foundation in C, a language renowned for its efficiency, performance, and role in systems programming.

The goal of this project is not just to learn syntax, but to develop the problem-solving and architectural skills of a professional software engineer. By the end of this journey, I aim to be able to conceptualize, plan, and build a full-fledged software application from scratch.

This curriculum is designed by my professional software engineer mentor and is structured to be hands-on, with a focus on practical application over rote memorization.

## My Learning Goals

1.  **Fundamental Mastery:** Gain a deep understanding of core C concepts, including data types, control flow, functions, and memory management.
2.  **Problem-Solving:** Learn to analyze client requests, break down complex problems into manageable components, and develop logical solutions.
3.  **Project Planning:** Practice full project lifecycle planning, from initial concept and design to implementation and debugging.
4.  **Professional Development:** Establish a strong professional portfolio on GitHub, demonstrating my skills and project work to potential employers and collaborators.
5.  **Build a Real-World Application:** Culminate the learning with a significant, multi-component project that serves as a capstone to this intensive course.

## Curriculum Breakdown (The 11-Day Plan)

Each day focuses on a specific set of concepts, building on the knowledge gained from the previous day.
